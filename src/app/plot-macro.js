    RATIONALE
     * A story may consist of several plots, each with it's own plot points.
     * Create one or more lists of plot points to step through as the player navigates.
     * Each time a location tagged passage is navigated to, the next point in each plot is evaluated.
     * If the filterCondition for a plot point evaluates to true, it is selected.
     * If the plot point contains no filterCondition,  it is selected.
     * When a plot point is selected, its associated scenePassage is included.
     * Once a plot point has been selected, it will not be selected again.
     * If there are multiple plots, the next point in each is evaluated in the order the plots were created.
     * When a plot point is selected, remaining plots will not be evaluated until the next location tagged passage is visited.

    USAGE
     * Plots should be defined in the special StoryInit passage, in the order you wish them evaluated.
     * Point tags must contain a scenePassage argument (in quotes if more than one word) which exists.
     * A plot point's scenePassage is usually a scene tagged passage containing a scene macro, though it is not a requirement.
     * If the first plot's first point has no filter condition, it will automatically be selected at the first location.
