<p class="itemText">Modern spacesuits aren’t nearly as bulky as those of the bygone Apollo and Shuttle eras, but they’re still no joy to don. Particularly the kind you’ve jammed your lanky, six-foot frame into. There are much better ones out there, everybody knows it. But in the interest of savings, this is basically the sort you’d find in a Dollar Store bargain bin. If Dollar Store sold spacesuits, that is.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Bill &amp; Lonnie (Rover Bay)</p>
<p class="itemText">Just as you enter the bay, Rover 3 rolls in from the surface. It comes to a perfect, auto-piloted stop at its charging station. The hydraulic door clangs shut, sending a small cloud of regolith into the relative vacuum of the bay.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lonnie Iverson, the colony’s life sciences officer, hops down from the cab, struggling with his ill-fitting suit. You are reminded of that old saw about packing 50 pounds of manure into a 10 pound bag.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Talk sense</p>
<p class="itemText">Lonnie Iverson looks like a man with a serious case of the space willies. More likely, you think, he’s had a little too much of that Martian Hydro he grows in some unknown location. The reason, in fact, that you’re hear to meet him. You’re going talk him down, find that location, and put an end to it. Schedules have been getting loose around here of late. And work, a little sloppy.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">You chin your suit-to-suit mic and walk toward him. “Listen, man. This place gets to everyone sooner or later. But...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Tell me</p>
<p class="itemText">“Aliens, huh?” You chuckle, goading him. “Did they have tentacles?”</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Iverson hangs his head, as far as helmet will let him. A drop of sweat plops onto the faceplate. “I didn’t…” he starts, then stops and takes a deep breath. “I don’t know. I only saw…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">He holds up one hand, and you can hear him huffing and puffing. Despite the circulators in his helmet, his faceplate begins to fog.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Show me</p>
<p class="itemText">You laugh. “If we weren’t alone on this rock — which we are — then we’d be the aliens here, Lonnie. You realize that, right?”</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You’d try and talk your own kid out of being born,” he says, genuinely angry at you. “If you had a gal to knock up, that is.”</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">That was a low blow. As leader of this colony, you can’t afford be distracted by romantic dalliances and Iverson knows it.

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Enough fooling around. Show me these aliens of yours. And then you’re taking me to your grow operation.” Spinning him around, you frogmarch him up into the rover’s cab.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“But Bill,” he pleads. “I need to do some maintenance before I take her out again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Bill &amp; Lonnie (Airlock)</p>
<p class="itemText">Even with Mars tugging at a mere third of Earth’s pull, moving Lonnie Iverson is as about as easy as wrestling a dead moose onto the hood of a Land Rover. As you attempt to drag him into the airlock, you in inadvertently cut open his suit on some loose regolith. The flakes are fine, but can slice like a razor. You hear nothing, but see a dusty plume rise from beneath his right knee.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Help’s on the way, Lonnie,” you tell him over suit-to-suit, hoping you’re right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>

<p class="itemText">After doffing your spacesuit in the Airlock, you make your way through the Central Hub to the Facilities Hub. On the far side of the expansive chamber, several off-duty folks are laughing and dancing to an old disco song. They wave and invite you over, but you’ve got your own boogie shoes on, and right now they’re shuffling like mad for the toilet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>
