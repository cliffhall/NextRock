Lonny Iverson has been growing weed in a purpose-fabricated pod in an unknown location. 

Bill Brewster, the colonyâ€™s chief executive (you), is on a mission to put an end to his grow operation and get things back on an even keel around here.

When you go to confront Iverson as he returns from a surface excursion, he claims to have found aliens.
