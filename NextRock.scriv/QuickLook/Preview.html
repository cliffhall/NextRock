<p class="itemText">Although modern spacesuits aren’t nearly as bulky as those worn by astronauts of the bygone Apollo and Shuttle eras, they’re still no joy to don. Particularly the kind you’ve jammed your lanky, six-foot frame into. There are much better ones out there, everybody knows it. But in the interest of savings, this is basically the sort you’d find in a Dollar Store bargain bin. If Dollar Store sold spacesuits, that is.</span></p></p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Harlan &amp; Bill (Rover Bay)</p>
<p class="itemText">Just as you enter the bay, Rover 3 rolls in from the surface. It comes to a perfect, auto-piloted stop at its charging station. The bay door clangs shut, sending a fine cloud of regolith into the relative vacuum of the bay.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bill Brewster, the colony’s life sciences officer, hops down from the cab, struggling with his ill-fitting suit. You are reminded of that old saw about packing 50 pounds of manure into a 10 pound bag.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">You chin your suit-to-suit mic and walk toward him. “Listen, man. This place gets to everyone sooner or later. But if this is your way of trying to get a spot back to Earth on the return leg of the next supply run, you’re gonna have to come up with something a tad more believable.”</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brewster hangs his head, as far as helmet will let him. A drop of sweat plops onto the faceplate. “I didn’t…” he starts then stops. “I don’t know. I only saw…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Semantics,” he says, frowning at you. “You’d try and talk your own kid into not being born. If you had a gal to knock up, that is.”</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">That was a low blow. As leader of this colony, you can’t afford be distracted by romantic dalliances and Brewster knows it. Celibacy is part of the job you signed up for. Plus, it’s not like he could ever attract a sighted mate himself.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Enough fooling around. You’re either going to show me these aliens, or you’re taking me to your grow operation. Or both!” Spinning him around, you frogmarch him up into the rover’s cab.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“But Harlan, I need to do some maintenance before I take her out again,” he pleads. You know better. Aside from the grime, the rover looks fine. Brewster just doesn’t want you shutting down his weed growing opera...</p>
